      <description>All of us own credit cards and some of us are capable of getting sound credit in the order of 20-30,000$ Which is interest free, it came to my mind that what if we invest or buy some form of riskless or guaranteed instrument for the grace period. ?
Obviously the process is not that simple, going to a nearby ATM and withdrawing from your credit card would be the craziest thing that you can do, as it attracts ~20% interest from that moment and turns out to be very costly.</description>
